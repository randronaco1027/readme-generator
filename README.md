The README generator operates from the Command Line. The program is built using the Inquirer NPM and works by prompting users a series of questions to autofill a README for their GitHub page. Once all prompts are answered then the README is generated locally and can be pushed to GitHub.

## Installation
npm init, npm install inquirer

## Usage
This program can be used to simply create a README with the proper formatting already completed for you!
